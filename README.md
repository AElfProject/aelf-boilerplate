Welcome to AElf Boilerplate's official GitHub repo !

Boilerplate is an environment that is used to develop smart contracts and dApps. Boilerplate shares some code with AElf and internally runs an AElf node.

## Getting Started

You can follow the tutorials [**here**](https://aelf-boilerplate-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that will get you started with contract development on Boilerplate. This tutorial also will guide you through the needed dependencies.

## Boilerplate

At the top level this repo contains two folders: **chain** and **web**. The chain folder contains code to facilitate contract development whereas the web folder contains the front end part of the dApp.

## chain

The process for developing the smart contract goes somewhat like this: define the smart contract, generate the code from the definition, implement the logic by using the generated code, test it and then deploy it.

The chain folder contains four sub-folders:
- **contract**: the implementation of the contract.
- **protobuf**: the definition of the contract.
- **test**: the unit tests of the contract.
- **src**: Boilerplate's core code, some elements need changing in here for the contract to be deployed.

## Versioning
We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for versioning, if you're intereted in closely following AElf's developement please check out the SemVer docs.
